It is determined by the speed at which a golfer swings their club and is a crucial factor in choosing the appropriate shaft flexibility for optimal performance. Golfers with slower swing speeds are generally better suited to softer shafts, which can help maximize their distance, while those with faster swing speeds require stiffer shafts to maintain control and efficiency in their shots. Alongside the concept of collision mass, swing speed plays a vital role in the mechanics of hitting the ball far, making it an essential consideration for golfers aiming to improve their game.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1739801434, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 354, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
