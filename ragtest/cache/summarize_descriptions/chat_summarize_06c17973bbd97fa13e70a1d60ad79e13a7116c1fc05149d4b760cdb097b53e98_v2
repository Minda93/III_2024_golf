Budney's research has explored the changes in grip strength during different phases of the golf swing, specifically examining the strength of the thumb and fingers. Additionally, Budney has investigated the impact of golf club weight distribution on swing biomechanics, discovering that the weight of the grip significantly influences a golfer's power. Through this comprehensive research, Budney has contributed valuable insights into the optimization of golf swing performance through biomechanical analysis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1739801438, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 312, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
