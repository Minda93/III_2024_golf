It refers to the specific point on a golf club shaft that exhibits the highest degree of bending when force is applied. This point is determined by calculating the ratio of the distance from this point to the end of the shaft. The selection of a low, medium, or high Bent Point influences the trajectory of the golf ball; lower points result in an increased launch angle, while higher points tend to lower it. Understanding and choosing the appropriate Bent Point is essential for golfers aiming to optimize their performance by adjusting the ball's flight path according to their needs and preferences.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1739801438, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 373, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
