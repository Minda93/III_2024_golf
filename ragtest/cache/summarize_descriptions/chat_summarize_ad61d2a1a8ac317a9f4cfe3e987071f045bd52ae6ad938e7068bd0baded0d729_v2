This effect influences the ball's spin and direction based on the design of the club and the angle of the swing. Specifically, the changes in the club face angle at the moment of impact can significantly affect the ball's rotational direction and its flight path. Overall, \"齒輪效應\" encapsulates the complex dynamics that govern how a golf ball behaves after being struck, highlighting the importance of both equipment design and technique in the game of golf.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1739804217, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_00428b782a", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
