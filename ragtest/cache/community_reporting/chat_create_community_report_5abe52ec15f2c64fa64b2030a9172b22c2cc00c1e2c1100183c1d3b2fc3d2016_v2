This entity is crucial as it determines how effectively a golfer can control their shots. The relationship between the swing path and the clubface (桿面) is particularly important, as it directly affects the trajectory and accuracy of the ball. A well-executed swing path can lead to better performance on the course, while a poor path can result in erratic shots. Understanding this relationship is essential for golfers aiming to improve their game.
