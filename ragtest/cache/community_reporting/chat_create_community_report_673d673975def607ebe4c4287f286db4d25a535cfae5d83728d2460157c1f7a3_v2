Each of these muscles plays a specific role in controlling and stabilizing the swing, which is crucial for achieving optimal performance. For instance, the deltoids are responsible for shoulder movement, which is vital for the swing's power and stability. The pectorals contribute significantly to the force exerted during the swing, while the latissimus dorsi aids in maintaining stability and strength throughout the motion.
