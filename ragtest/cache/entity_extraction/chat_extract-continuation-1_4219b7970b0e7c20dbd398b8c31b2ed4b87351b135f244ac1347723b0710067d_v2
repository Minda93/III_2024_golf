--\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊編輯委員會\n\n參、 桿身規格 (shaft specifications)\n一、長度 (length)\n除了推桿以外，每支球桿全長必須至少有18吋，絕不可以超過48吋（1.219公尺）。\n對於木桿和鐵桿，在量測長度時，要讓球桿至於一個水平面上，且讓桿頭底部設定\n頂著一個60度角的平面（圖五）。球桿長度的界定是從這兩個平面的交會點到握把\n頂端的距離。至於推桿，球桿長度的測量則是從握把頂端沿著桿身軸線的直線一直\n延伸到桿頭底部。\n\n圖五、球桿長度。\n球桿長度越長，揮桿圓弧就越大，因而更有可能達到更大的桿頭速度，桿頭速\n度愈大相對的擊球距離就能夠增加。但是球桿長度越長，揮桿弧度增加，控制性也\n越差，越難以桿面中心擊中球，而造成方向的不穩定。\n二、重量 (weight )\n桿身的質量測量，以克或盎司為單位。桿身由握把頂端至離桿頭底部不超過5吋\n（127mm）且必須是筆直的。球桿重量對擊球時最大影響在於揮桿時的感覺，桿身\n重量是最能影響球桿總重量的元素。桿身重量愈輕，球桿總重就愈輕。當然在揮桿\n時的感覺也會因為球桿桿身的輕重而感到相對的不同。\n三、硬度 Flex\n球桿身硬度指桿身被施以縱向時所產生反彎折阻力。在一般市面上基本硬度由\n軟到硬可分：L、A、R、S、X。越軟的球桿揮動起來的彈性較大，越硬的球桿則就\n彈性較小。依照使用者的揮桿速度和力量來選擇適合的桿身。雖然各家球具供應商\n都以以上英文字母為代表，但並不代表了甲廠商和乙廠商的桿身硬度的標準是一樣\n\n-- 54 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊 第九期\n\n的。\n四、桿身材質\n桿身的材質主要分為鐵製桿身與碳纖維桿身。\n鐵製桿身：重量較重，扭力較小，職業選手因力量較大揮桿速度較快且為保有\n擊球時的穩定性，大部份會選擇鐵製桿身。\n碳纖維桿身：重量較輕、扭力較大彈性也比較好，在擊球時能有較大的彈性，\n和鐵製桿身相比不需要強力擊球也能達到較好的擊球效果，較適合一般球友和女性\n球友選用。\n\n（鐵製桿身）\n（碳纖維桿身）\n圖六、鐵製與碳纖維桿身。\n\n肆、握把規格
