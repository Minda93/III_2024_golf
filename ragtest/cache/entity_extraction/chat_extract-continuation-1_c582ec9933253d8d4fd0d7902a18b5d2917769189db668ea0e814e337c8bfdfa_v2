。\n高爾夫球運動的進步與否，在於運動能力的穩定而非最大運動表現，適合各種\n\n-- 49 --\n\n\n\n身體能力的人來學習，不能跑很快、跳很遠的人，也可以打好高爾夫球。而且，就\n算是身材不太突出的 Craig Parry (圖一) ，也能成為優異的高爾夫運動員。\n\n圖一、Craig Parry 的身材也能成為優異的高爾夫運動員\n高爾夫球運動在寬廣的草地或樹林間進行，優美與翠綠的環境，不打球都覺得\n很愉快。高爾夫球重視自我能力的進展，運動者的對手就是球場的設計與自己，打\n得好的人自然可以得到\"低桿\"的樂趣，打得不好的人也有很多的安慰術語：\n「今天有\n一個洞打了 2 個 PAR」\n、「桿數越多越划算 (花的錢一樣)」、「怎麼打都是 80 (他說的\n是體重不是桿數)」。無論如何，學習高爾夫運動、參與在綠色草坪上的揮桿運動，\n絕對會讓參與者健康、心情愉快、充滿自信。\n不過，要實際的參與高爾夫運動還是需要具備一定水準的高爾夫揮桿技術與能\n力，否則不容易輕鬆愉快的參與高爾夫。本文的目的即希望針對高爾夫相關的研究\n成果，設計一個高爾夫揮桿動作的檢核表格，由不同的揮桿動作要素中，進一步釐\n清與檢視高爾夫揮桿動作的精髓。\n\n貳、高爾夫揮桿動作的研究\n具備優異的高爾夫揮桿技術，一直是成為高爾夫運動參與者的最基本要求，否\n則打不到球、打不好球的狀況頻傳，將會顯著影響高爾夫運動參與的意願。\n有關高爾夫揮桿速度、加速度的相關研究方面。高爾夫揮桿動作是由許多連結\n的動作所合成的，這些動作包括左膝蓋的向前活動、臀部的旋轉、脊柱的旋轉、肩\n關節的活動與腕和手的活動等活動的結合 (Cooper 等, 1974) 。Neal 與 Wilson\n\n-- 50 --\n\n\n\n(1985) 、Shibayama 與 Ebashi (1983) 的研究皆發現，從上揮頂點至擊球瞬間桿頭的\n速度會呈逐漸增加的趨勢，在擊球後速度則逐漸降低直到結束。Shibayama 與 Ebashi\n(1983) 的研究也發現，高爾夫球飛行的初速度和擊球前桿頭的速度有顯著的正相關\n(r=0.958)。Neal 與 Wilson (1985) 也發現，球桿肢段重心的加速度時間曲線的Ｘ軸部\n份的最大值出現在擊球前 40ms 時，而手臂肢段的力量時間曲線的Ｘ軸的力量峰值\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
