，所做高爾夫旋轉肌群運動傷害的實驗，將動作分為上桿\n期 (takeaway 或 back swing ) 、 下 桿 期 (forward 或 down swing) 、 加 速 期\n(acceleration) 、跟隨早期 (early follow through) 、跟隨晚期 (late follow through) ，\n並發現選手下桿的肌肉收縮順序是背闊肌早於胸大肌，因下桿期下身的扭轉產生背\n闊肌的伸展與收縮，加速期肱三頭肌、肩甲肌等上體與胸大肌協同收縮活動，由此\n可知，肌肉作用的順序是由下而上的力量傳遞 (楊沛峰，2002) 。\n三、高爾夫揮桿的槓桿原理\n過去的高爾夫複擺研究皆以雙複擺作探討，如Paul (1970) 以左肩為旋轉中\n心，而以左臂與桿身為雙複擺觀念，進行有關高爾夫擊球準確性的實驗，他們認為\n旋轉中心點與複擺關係的模式，是以手臂為上方槓臂，即是複擺第一節；而球桿為\n下方槓臂，即是複擺第二節，而將左肩關節當成是旋轉中心點，然而實際揮桿時左\n肩為持續移動的狀態，所以並不能以左肩與擊球精準的關係作探討，直至Turenr 及\nHill (1998) 開始打破以往最普遍的雙複擺觀念，而趨向於三複擺 (3 link mathematical\n\n-- 71 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫委員會\n\nmodel) 的研究 (圖二) ，發現肩膀應為複擺第一節，左手臂為複擺第二節，球桿為\n複擺第三節，而第一節的原始近端位於旋轉軸—脊椎上，而此三複擺的旋轉中心點\n即是趨向於軸頂點的位置所在。\n\n圖二\n\n左為雙複擺；右為三複擺 (楊沛峰，2002) 。\n\n楊沛峰 (2002) 的研究指出，從解剖位置、擊球前頭不動、下桿順序、三複擺\n及3D立體鐘擺的頂點，五個方向對軸頂點作較深入的驗證與探討，三複擺的研究為\n推翻雙複擺以左肩關節為旋轉中心的驗證，而Toski等 (1998) 說明了脊椎為揮桿旋\n轉系統的旋轉軸，更進一步指出，頸椎上有一凸起點稱為懸掛點，而揮桿平面與此\n點 相交，此懸掛點至球的假想直線即是揮桿的半徑，所以此點的移動將直接影響揮\n桿平面以及擊到球的位置，而在解剖位置上也發現兩肩關節 (肩峰突) 的中點在\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FRANK<|>PERSON<|>Frank is
