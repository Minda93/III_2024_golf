�線往後運行，這樣較能產生正確的軌道（Norman,\n2000）。在為了檢視這個問題，通常可透過攝錄影或以慢動作反覆來回溯檢\n查擊球瞬間桿身與球接觸的垂直面，如果球桿面接觸球的角度與目標線是垂\n直的，表示軌道正確，如果發現桿身的角度太向前傾斜或太後倒桿，表示揮\n桿軌道都出了問題。\n參、揮桿身體動作與桿頭移動關聯性\n由於揮桿屬高複雜性動作，且動作之間的關聯性極高。從揮桿前之握桿（Grip）\n，\n腳步與站姿（Stance & Address），瞄準（Aim）的準備動作。再到動作開始之啟桿\n（Take-away），向後揮桿（Back-swing），向後頂點揮桿（Top of Back-swing）後，\n再經由向下揮桿（Down-swing）的啟動，至碰撞（Impact）擊球後的尾隨（Follow\nThrough）到最後的自然收桿結束完成動作，都必須要有靈敏的身體感覺及流暢的節\n奏為主導。所以，為正確改善揮桿動作誤差的產生，除對揮桿原理應有理解外，應\n先從揮桿身體動作的因素來作探討改善，以達到預期的效果與目的。\n從整個揮桿動作過程序列步驟來分析，實質上分為揮桿前的準備動作及揮桿動\n作兩個序列步驟。前者的動作雖無關桿頭移動方式，但也攸關影响爾後的揮桿動作；\n而後者的動作則牽動桿頭移動方式的主要因素。佛利克、席夫曼等（2006）指出在\n整個揮桿動作的過程是結合了水平轉動、側向移動及垂直移動等三種方式進行。就\n整個揮桿過程序列步驟之各時期身體動作與桿頭移動的關連性，依整個揮桿過程以\n擊球瞬間的桿頭移動方式作為分際，可分為向後與向前擺動揮桿兩個時期。\n一、向後擺動揮桿時期的桿頭移動方式\n（一）啟桿開始：始自球桿起動開始，並將桿頭沿著目標線，向後延伸至八點鐘位\n置或雙手後擺至褲口袋處，則為啟桿動作結束；此時桿頭是呈水平方式進行\n直到啟桿動作結束。又當雙腕開始轉動彎屈之際，桿頭的移動轉以側向移動\n方式來進行，直到向後揮動作開始時結束。\n（二）向後揮動作：當向後揮動作開始時又轉為垂直移動方式進行直到抵達頂點揮\n桿時停止。\n二、向前擺動揮桿時期的桿頭移動方式\n（一）向下擺動揮桿：由於向下揮桿動作開始後至桿頭面打到球的過程中可分成兩\n階段。第一階段是由向下擺動揮桿動作開始，此時桿頭是以自\n######################\nOutput:",
