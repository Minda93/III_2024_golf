與 Wilson (1985) 也發現，球桿肢段重心的加速度時間曲線的Ｘ軸部\n份的最大值出現在擊球前 40ms 時，而手臂肢段的力量時間曲線的Ｘ軸的力量峰值則\n出現在擊球前 85ms 時。這時間的數據說明了，球桿重心的加速度峰值比手臂肢段加\n速度峰值更接近擊球點，Milburn (1982) 也所提出類似的論點，即較大 (重) 或較近\n端的肢段其加速度的峰值會比較輕、而且較末端的肢段的加速度峰值更早出現。綜\n和上述研究發現，揮桿時，球桿的速度從上揮頂點至擊球時速度會逐漸的增加，但\n其峰值則出現在擊球後。在加速度上，肢段較輕或較末端的肢段其加速度的峰值較\n靠近擊球點，如球桿重心的加速度峰值較手臂的加速度的峰值更靠近擊球點。\n有關高爾夫揮桿時用力方式的相關研究方面。Shibayama 與 Ebashi (1983) 的研\n究發現，擊球時對球桿的握力與球的初速度的關係成平方的關係。Miburn (1982) 的\n研究指出，在下揮動作開始時，延遲不屈腕 (uncocking) 的動作的出現可以使手臂\n的加速度達到最大值，以及使得球桿的加速度等於近端肢段所產生的加速度的總\n和。其他研究也指出，腕關節的合力，在下揮期時會在Ｙ和Ｚ軸產生順時針的運動，\n這種現象可防止下揮動作約在 100ms 時腕關節產生不屈腕 (uncocking) 現象 (Neal\n& Wilson,1985) 。Budney 與 Bellow (1982) 則發現不管採用哪一個球桿擊球，延遲\n手腕的不屈腕動作確實是優秀高爾夫選手的動作特徵 (圖二) 。綜合上述的研究發\n現，下揮動作開始時，延遲不屈腕動作(uncocking) 出現的時間將可以使手臂的加速\n度達到最大值，且可使球桿的加速度等於近端加速度的總和。\n\n圖二、揮桿動作的左手腕延遲不屈腕動作 (Budney & Bellow, 1982)\n\n-- 51
