陳淑貞 莊英萬\n元智大學\n摘要\n本文主要目的在提供初學習或進階者在學習高爾夫時，建立正確的揮桿擊球摡\n念。經由理解如何獲得球飛行距離與影响方向誤差的因素後，再由揮桿之身體連續\n動作之順序步驟與桿頭移動途徑的方式，逐一探討其關聯性與要領，以茲提供建立\n正確的揮桿概念，從中導出不良的揮桿問題所在，提供自我修正及建立正確的動作，\n進而提升揮桿技術。由於不當的揮桿身體動作序列步驟將影響爾後球的飛行效果，\n而一般的學習者常因欠缺或接受到有系統原理知識，導致無法體會自己的揮桿心\n得，進而逐步修正，來達成自我修正，建立正確的揮桿動作。因此我們必須認知正\n確的揮桿動作序列步驟要領與桿頭移動關聯性及球的飛行原理及基本法則，才能夠\n分辨動作的原委。並遵循揮桿動作的基本法則與要領，養成正確的揮桿前準備動作\n與揮桿動作，再加上有效的練習方法，就能夠根據個人的差異去發展自己適合的揮\n桿動作。\n關鍵詞：高爾夫、揮桿、桿頭移動\n\n壹、前言\n打高爾夫，其實一點也不難，不外乎選對球桿，將球送至目標區而已。然而，\n要達到此目的，必須先對揮桿身體連續動作整體序列與桿頭移動方式之關聯性，及\n有關球的飛行理論有所瞭解後，進而從中理出問題，才能得以自我判斷、自我分析\n擊球情況。因此，本文先藉由「影響球的飛行」等因素，再透過對揮桿連續動作之\n順序與桿頭移動方式的關聯性，理出揮桿要領，以此焦點進行自我修正，建立正確\n的動作。其主要目的在幫助初學或進階者，如何去釐清揮桿碰到的問題，而不是毫\n無系統地去改變或修正自己的揮桿節奏與方式，導致揮桿動作問題越來越嚴重。\n許多人學習高爾夫，常因沒有正確的揮桿要領，而球擊不出理想的方向與距\n離。為了解決此問題，我們常常有意無意去吸收不同有關揮桿資訊與建議並納為己\n用；例如想模仿某球星的上桿時肩膀如何轉、重心的轉移如何等等，而改變了自己\n原來的揮桿方式。有些建議雖好，對進階者也確實有幫助，但如果不知是否適合自\n己而一味地盲目跟從，最後可能整體揮桿動作都走�\n######################\nOutput:",
