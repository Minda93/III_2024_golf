大專高爾夫學刊編輯委員會\n\n高爾夫揮桿動作、球具規格與右曲球的關係\n王宏宗 1 吳兆欣 2\n1\n臺北市立體育學院 2 大仁科技大學\n摘要\n現代高爾夫被過度複雜化後的返璞歸真。將揮桿的因果、主動與被動做一次完\n整的定義，將可以使高爾夫球友更自然而然、沒負擔地享受高爾夫，在打球時有空\n閒時間欣賞球場上的美景，體會設計師的用意。握桿、延遲擊球、防止右曲球之下\n半身轉動、重心移轉等揮桿動作，桿身長度、握把、底角、齒輪效應等球具規格，\n都是造成高爾夫出現右曲球的重要因素，也是高爾夫揮桿時的重要考量變項。唯有\n知道自己的球桿與動作，你就可以快速脫離揮桿的困擾，本文根據相關重要變項進\n行詳細的解說，以便讓球友具備更優異的高爾夫表現。\n關鍵詞：高爾夫揮桿、右曲球、握把、角底、齒輪效應\n\n壹、前言\n近年前，有關高爾夫球桿的量身定作與揮桿技術的相關研究已大量被發表，在\n基本的高爾夫揮桿訓練理論上是不變的，但是隨著球桿製作科技與量身定作球桿的\n日益發達，修正球飛行路線似乎不再是只有動作的問題，不適當的球桿只會造成更\n多且難以修正的問題。本文就以球桿的規格與揮桿技術結合探討高爾夫球飛行的關\n係。\n\n貳、揮桿動作的相關研究\n高爾夫的揮桿是手臂、手腕與球桿的連動結果，你的任何身體轉動與移位，都\n是要創造出這個連動性，並讓它發生在正確的時刻。我們如果從職業球員的揮桿分\n析動作來看，你會見到左手臂與桿身之間的相對關係：瞄球時幾乎成一直線，起桿\n時桿身先跑，與左手臂的夾角愈來愈大，形成曲腕的效果而至上桿頂點；下桿的時\n候，左手臂與桿身的角度保持住一起往下掉，左手臂領先桿身，逐漸地做出釋放，\n通過觸球後，桿身又超前左手臂，最後完成整個揮桿動作。\nLeadbetter（1990）提出的軀體軸轉動作提供了三個重要的成份，表現於揮桿時。\n\n--
