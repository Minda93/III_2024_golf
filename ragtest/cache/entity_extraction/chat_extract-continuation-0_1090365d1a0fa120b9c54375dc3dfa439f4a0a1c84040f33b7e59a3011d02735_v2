第五期\n\n綜評高爾夫下揮桿之腕部釋放技巧\n楊佳元 1 鄭誠諒 2 湯文慈 2\n1\n國立臺南藝術大學 2 國立臺灣體育大學 (桃園)\n摘要\n高爾夫球是一項注重球的精準度和飛行距離遠近的運動，要將球擊的遠，取決\n於擊球前的桿頭速度。增加桿頭的速度，其技巧性可說是相當繁多，不過腕部的釋\n放動作，則是目前最多人討論的焦點。腕部本身雖無法單獨產生極大的力量和速度，\n但藉由肩關節和肘關節的力量產生移動速度，而速度的累加過程會造就肢段末端產\n生較大的速度，藉此進一步為手持球桿的桿頭加速。桿頭速度的快慢，在於參與高\n爾夫揮桿動作過程中，肌肉所產生的力矩 (Torque) 。目前許多有關高爾夫揮桿的\n運動生物力學文章提出，手腕動作是影響高爾夫運動的表現之一，並確信手腕在曲\n腕後的釋放動作能夠增加桿頭速度，進而提升運動表現。不同的實驗方式，其結果\n有其歸納整理的必要性。因此，本篇的目的是將腕部釋放動作與桿頭速度的相關文\n獻做一整理和探討。\n關鍵詞：下揮桿、腕部釋放\n\n壹、前言\n每一項競技運動都有屬於自己本身的特性存在，以高爾夫球運動而言，其特性\n則是注重球的精準度和飛行距離遠近。要將球擊的遠，取決於擊球前的桿頭速度，\n桿頭速度越快，球飛行的距離則越遠，而為了要有快速的桿頭速度，力量和技巧性\n不僅是必需的，且彼此是息息相關的。力量是所有運動的基本要素，力量大則能在\n揮桿過程中產生較快的肢段速度，而對於增加桿頭速度的技巧性，腕部的釋放動作\n是目前最多人討論的焦點。腕部位於身體上肢的末端，雖無法單獨產生極大的力量\n和速度，但藉由肩關節和肘關節的力量產生移動速度，而速度的累加過程會造就肢\n段末端產生較大的速度，藉此進一步為手持球桿的桿頭加速，促使桿頭在擊球前能\n產生較大的速度。Milburn (1980) 提出腕部因位於身體上肢的末端，能夠因參與整\n體動作的肢段數目，以其一連串的力量傳導順序來產生在末達最大速度。由此可知，\n腕部的釋放動作在增加桿頭速度上，是個相當重要的技巧，而且也紛紛引起許多學\n者把焦點放在腕部動作上，並利用高速攝影機或是電�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
