作用於球上，來產生\n距離。然過度增加桿頭速度，可能造成擊球時距離無法精準，過輕則擊球無\n法發揮力量，無距離感。事實上，只要揮動球桿能達到最大桿頭速度的 65%\n就夠了，因為這個速度在偏離正確軌道的機率是最小的 (Linda & DeDe，\n1984) 。因此在擊球準備時避免肩膀、握桿太僵硬或太緊情況，在揮桿時桿\n頭以自然、穩定地在軌道上運行，只要學會控制身體良好的重心移轉讓動作\n與球桿在揮桿過程中能相互配合，並將桿頭重量釋放出來，就能夠讓球桿頭\n產生足夠的速度與在正確軌道上去擊球。\n（二）球桿面的擊球點：當球桿面擊中球時越接近桿面的甜蜜點如下圖一，所擊出\n的球越紮實，亦能獲得理想的飛行距離。反之，如果與球接觸面是靠在桿面\n的跟部或前端，就會讓球失去距離 （王進郎，1990）\n。但 Linda 與 DeDe（1984）\n指出即使是最好的球員也無法每次都精確地擊在甜蜜點上，我們所能做的是\n\n-- 29 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊編輯委員會\n\n盡量增加擊在甜蜜點上的機率。因此，為了增加擊中桿面的甜蜜點的機率，\n也就是盡量讓自己的揮桿軌道正確，使桿面方正地擊中球。\n（三）下桿擊球方式：所謂下桿擊球方式，是指下桿擊球時的揮桿平面與擊球角度。\n如果擊球角度太大或太小時，球桿擊球面無法與球完全平貼，減少擊球的面\n積。由於揮桿平面與擊球位置是決定擊球角度的因素；在高爾夫球桿裡，各\n球桿因其號數的不同，它的桿頭底角、桿身長度及桿面仰角亦有所不同。因\n此，各球桿的擊球角度/下桿方式與揮桿平面擊球的位置亦有不同。以鐵桿為\n例；短鐵桿的擊球位置是在桿頭於揮桿平面呈最低點前先擊中球，揮桿平面\n較陡峭的角度來擊球。中鐵桿是在桿頭於揮桿平面最低點擊中球，揮桿平面\n介於長、短鐵桿中間的角度來擊球。長鐵桿則於揮桿平面最低點後，桿頭滑\n過揮桿平面最低點之後往上揚的那一段擊中球；揮桿平面較淺平的角度來擊\n球（王宏宗，2005）。\n二、影響球飛行方向要素\n（一）正確站姿：布萊德利（2006）指出理想的擊球準備姿勢，其功能有以下三點：\n1、增加靈活度，防止運動傷害。2、讓脊柱�\n######################\nOutput:",
