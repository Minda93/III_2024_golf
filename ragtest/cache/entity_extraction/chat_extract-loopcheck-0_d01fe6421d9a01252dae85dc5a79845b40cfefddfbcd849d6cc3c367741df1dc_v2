摘要\n本文的目的在針對高爾夫相關的研究成果，設計一個高爾夫揮桿動作的檢核表\n格，由不同的揮桿動作要素中，進一步釐清與檢視高爾夫揮桿動作的精髓。透過文\n獻整理高爾夫揮桿動作的研究論文，彙整高爾夫揮桿的五個階段：上揮期 (take\naway) 、 下 揮 前 期 (forward swing) 、 加 速 期 (acceleration) 、 跟 隨 前 期 (early\nfollow-through) 與跟隨後期 (late follow-through)，針對各個揮桿階段進行詳細的動\n作焦點評析，進而獲得高爾夫揮桿動作的檢核標準內容。球打遠的用力方法方面，\n如何獲得更有效益的完整揮桿擊球，需要軀幹、雙手、身體動作的整體配合。控制\n高爾夫球揮桿飛行方向的靜態變項 (握桿、球位、站姿、桿面角度、步伐大小、站\n姿方向、地面坡度等)，是每一位學習高爾夫球的初學者，最需要事先瞭解的高爾夫\n揮桿概念。揮桿動作動態變項，包括左手手腕的角度、右手肘關節位置、右膝的穩\n定、重心左右移動、重心前後移動、揮桿平面、揮桿的時間分配、揮桿碰撞時的相\n對位置、揮桿方向、以及收桿方向等，都是進行高爾夫揮桿動作分析依據。高爾夫\n揮桿動作很快，往往需要透過攝影分析的方式進行揮桿動作的紀錄，進而透過進一\n步的揮桿動作重複慢速觀察，依據影響高爾夫揮桿動作的檢核標準表一一檢視，將\n會獲得更佳的高爾夫揮桿動作學習效益。\n關鍵詞：高爾夫、動作檢核標準表、攝影分析\n\n壹、前言\n高爾夫球是屬於個人性的運動項目，自己一個人就可以練習與運動。在進行高\n爾夫球運動時，可以輕鬆的方式進行，也可以非常激烈的進行 (快走或跑步) ，高爾\n夫揮桿與推桿本身的運動方式也講求輕鬆，因此可以以此高爾夫運動作為「終身運\n動」。\n高爾夫球的揮桿動作是以身體的脊椎為旋轉中心軸，可以進行全身性的肌肉與\n神經活動，有益身體脊椎功能的養成與維持。高爾夫球也重視認知與心靈 (心理) 的\n學習，不是只有身體的訓練；沒有心理上的訓練不會打好高爾夫球。\n高爾夫球運動的進步與否，在於運動能力的穩定而非最大運動表現，適合各種\n\n-- 49 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊編輯委員會\n\n身體能力的人來學習，不能跑很快\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
