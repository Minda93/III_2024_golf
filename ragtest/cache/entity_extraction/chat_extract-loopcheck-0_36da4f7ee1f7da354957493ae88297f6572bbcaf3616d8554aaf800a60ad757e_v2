小，長度\n愈長，重量愈輕。除了按照桿柄的長度、球桿頭部和桿柄的角度各有一個固定的角\n度以外，還有桿柄和球桿底部的角度 (lie)、擊球面的角度 (loft) ，這些因素皆會影\n響擊球的距離與球飛行的路線。由於運動科技的進步，高爾夫球桿的設計上也產生\n了變化，如碳纖桿、不同握把的設計等，到底這些設計對選手的運動表現是否有幫\n助呢？Budney (1979) 研究球桿重量分配對揮桿時的生物力學上的變項的影響發\n現，空氣拖曳力對揮桿動作的影響極小，而增加球桿握把的重量對高爾夫選手產生\n力量極有影響。研究者發現當揮桿重量 (swing weight) 增加而桿長不變時，高爾夫\n選手所產生的最大總動量、最大力矩、最大手臂揮動力量……等動力學因素皆較大。\nMilne 與 Davis (1992) 研究發現，以不同的可彎曲度的球桿揮桿時，球桿的可彎曲度\n對揮桿動作的動力影響極小，這論點推翻了傳統對球桿桿柄的可彎曲度設計的重\n視。Cooper 等 (1974) 研究使用 1 、3 、7 號不同球桿的動作差異，在下揮開始時\n其左右兩腳重心轉移的模式並沒有差異，在跟隨動作時，使用 7 號桿揮桿時的重心\n落在前腳的百分比為三者中最大，使用 1 號桿時則有最少的重量落於前腳，在跟隨\n動作的最後，使用 7 號桿時，有約 80% 的力量落在前腳，而使用 1 號桿則有約 70%\n的力量落在前腳。綜合上述研究可發現，加重球桿握把的重量或增加揮桿重量\n(swing weight) 有助於揮桿時的動力產生。球桿的可彎曲度 (shift) 對揮桿的動力的\n影響不大。使用不同球桿擊球時其重量轉移的模式的差異，主要出現的跟隨動作上。\nRichards 等 (1985) 針對揮桿動作時的重心轉移研究發現，在上揮頂點時，有\n73-79%的垂直力量置於後腳 (back foot) ，而在擊球瞬間置於後腳的垂直力量只有\n5-19% ，然後隨著擊球後的跟隨動作，垂直力量將全部轉移至目標腳 (target foot) 。\n有關垂直力量的前後轉移方面，在上揮頂點時，約有 44-46%的垂直力量落於腳跟，\n而在擊球時，則會因受試者的程度而有差異，程度較好的受試者在擊球時約有 66%\n的力量落在腳跟，而程度較差的選手則有 49% 的力量落在腳跟。而在擊完球後，技\n術較好者其垂直力量的中心點向\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
