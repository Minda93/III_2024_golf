的研究則針對優異與一般高爾夫選手的軀幹旋轉狀況進行分析，發現軀幹的\n扭轉角度與角速度兩個變項，都有優異選手大於一般選手的現象，身體軀幹的扭轉\n確實是揮桿動力的主要來源之一 (圖四)。\n\n\n\n優秀與一般高爾夫運動者之間，儘管揮桿的速度相同，職業球員所擊出之球的\n飛行初速度較業餘球員大。技術好的球員在擊球瞬間的放較多的重量趨向腳跟，而\n技術較差的球員放較多的重量趨向腳尖；技術較差的球員在揮桿的動作中會提早使\n用手臂來增加球桿的速度；優秀秀球員的轉動半徑 (從轉動中心至桿頭) 的最大值出\n現在接近擊球點時，而初學者則出現在擊球後。\n高爾夫球揮桿動作是一三度空間的動作模式，為一多關節聯合的動作，身體的\n控制模式相當的複雜，若要完全了解其動作在運動學上和動力學上的變化，則需以\n精密的儀器來研究。目前在高爾夫揮桿的研究大部分以測力板、攝影資料分析法及\n肌電圖等方法來研究，或是以單一方法，或是聯合幾種方法，但由於所使用的受試\n者同質性的差異、研究方法上的不盡相同等，使有關高爾夫揮桿動作特徵的描述，\n仍有顯著的差異存在。\n\n參、高爾夫揮桿動作的分期\n高爾夫揮桿動作的分期常隨著研究者或其研究目的的不同，而有不一樣的分\n期。Maddalozzo (1987) 認為一個完整的揮桿動作 (the full golf swing) 可分為三個步\n驟，預備期 (preparation) 包括握桿、立於擊球位置、做好擊球姿勢等，動作期\n\n\n\n(execution) 包括上揮 (backswing)、下揮 (downswing) 、結束跟隨動作 (follow\n-through) 。Neal, Abernethy 與 Moran (1990) 將高爾夫揮桿動作以四個點劃分為三階\n段，第一階段為上揮期 (back swing) ：從瞄球點到上揮頂點；第二階段為開始期\n(initiation)：從上揮頂點至腕關節的角度達最小角度時，第三階段為擊球期 (hitting)：\n從腕關節達最小角度至擊球點。Pink, Perry 與 Jobe (1993) 將高爾夫揮桿動作分成五\n個時期，包括上揮期 (take away)、下揮前期 (forward swing)、加速期 (acceleration)、\n跟隨前期 (early follow-through) 與跟隨後期 (late follow-through)，各時期的動作為：\n(1).上揮期 (take away)：從球的位置後轉 (backswing) 至動作最後定點，上揮頂點。\n(2).下揮前期 (forward swing) ：從上揮頂點揮桿至球桿呈水平的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IZAWA<|>PERSON<|>Izawa is a researcher who analyzed the trunk rotation conditions of
