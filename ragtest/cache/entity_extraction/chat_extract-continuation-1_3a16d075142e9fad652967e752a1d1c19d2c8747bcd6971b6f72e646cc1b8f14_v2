�球桿\n重量來增加揮桿桿頭速度或加長球桿使擊球更遠。丁麗芬、林寶城（2004）的研究\n指出，重桿身比輕桿身具備較佳擊球準確度。馬義傑（2007）的論文則指出，選擇\n適當的桿身重量，可以在不用犧牲穩定性等其他條件的情況下，就能擁有更快的桿\n頭速度以及更遠的擊球距離。由於，市面上球桿類型千千萬萬種，適合職業選手的\n\n-- 56 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊 第九期\n\n球桿不一定適合自己，所以在購買前的「試打」是非常重要的一環。\n依照自己的性別、身高、體重和肌肉強度和耐力來挑選球桿是基本的概念，在\n更進階的電腦儀器，能測量出球桿揮桿速度和擊球初速來選擇合適自己的球桿（王\n宏宗、吳兆欣，2000b）。當我們選對了適合自己的體態、體能和揮桿動作、揮桿速\n度的球桿時，更能減少擊球時的失誤，也能夠減少因球桿桿身的軟硬度不適應本身\n而產生的後遺症；不適合球桿擊球的後遺症包括：球的飛行距離不足、容易產生過\n多的左曲球或右曲球、桿頭速度無法達到最快，進而使用更多補嘗力量造成擊球不\n穩定等等情況產生（王宏宗、吳兆欣，2000a；王宏宗、吳兆欣，2009；石翔至、翁\n焜煌、陳文雄，2007；王雅芬、馮勝杰、劉于詮、黃泰源，2010；王宏宗、陳姿吟，\n2011）。\n\n陸、結語\n現今高爾夫球桿為了達到更遠的距離和更高的穩定度都採輕量設計，減輕球桿\n重量來增加揮桿桿頭速度或加長球桿使擊球更遠。高爾夫球桿的發展，除了一般球\n友能更容易擊出好球之外，職業選手更高的操控性、更輕鬆的擊球距離延伸、以及\n擊球方向穩定性使得比賽成績一再突破。當我們了解適合自己的球桿的相關知識與\n功能下，並且實際應用在擊球上，創造屬於個人佳績和穩定性就更加容易了。\n######################\nOutput:",
