動作，進而使桿頭加速的功能。除此之\n外，亦有學者測量球桿的力矩值，來探討使用手腕釋放動作與球桿的力矩值的關聯\n性。\nNeal and Wilson (1985) 測量球桿之重心 (center of gravity) 的速度和加速度方\n式，進一步間接探討手腕釋放 (uncocking of the wrist) 時間，使用兩台高速攝影機進\n行拍攝並同步化，兩者放置位置與受試者揮桿位置呈夾角 160 度，拍攝頻率設為每\n秒 294 張，分別對四名職業選手及兩位低差點的優秀選手 (平均年齡 25 歲) ，以五\n號鐵桿進行 3D 揮桿動作拍攝，並定義在立體空間中，以雙腳平行的為 X 軸；與軀\n幹平行的為 Y 軸；與軀幹垂直的為 Z 軸。其研究結果顯示在高爾夫下揮桿時，手腕\n的平均釋放時間為擊球前的 100 毫秒 (ms) 至 80 毫秒 (ms) ，且發現球桿在下桿擊\n球有明顯加速度產生，其最大加速度產生點為擊球前的 40 毫秒 (ms) ，並達到 870\nm/s2。因而進一步提出其會有明顯加速度的產生是因手腕延遲釋放的結果。\nJorgensen (1994) 以手臂和球桿兩個部份所組成的模型，使用電腦模擬的方式，\n在平面上產生動作，以慣性滑行 (Freewheeling) 的理論，勘查揮桿動作的過程，於\n其模擬結果中顯示出，在下桿時，發現高爾夫球員會利用曲腕動作以減少手腕與前\n臂的夾角角度 (decrease the wrist-cock angle) ，而由此表現出在擊球時的桿頭速度會\n比高爾夫球員自然地使用腕關節還具有較少的桿頭速度。因此，他分析出在下桿期\n間手腕所產生的力矩是沒有作用的。對於會有這個結果產生，可能是因為 Jorgensen\n學者忽略到腕關節且將手臂和球桿兩個部份定義為一個系統模型，並把手腕肢段長\n度認定為是球桿的延長，成為一個固體，以致於位在身體末端的手腕無法做釋放動\n作，而有此結果產生。\nMcLaughlin and Best (1994) 以兩台攝影機與受試者的角度呈 90 度角，同步化拍\n攝揮桿動作方式，以 PEAK 軟體作數據資料分析，比較優秀選手與非優秀選手在揮\n桿過程中，身體上肢其相互夾角的差異，其結果顯現出優秀選手的左手臂與桿身的\n夾角不僅比非優秀選手的夾角小且造就在桿頭上有較快的速度產生。並且提出手腕\n太早釋放會減少桿頭速度，而如有其適當的手腕延遲釋\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
