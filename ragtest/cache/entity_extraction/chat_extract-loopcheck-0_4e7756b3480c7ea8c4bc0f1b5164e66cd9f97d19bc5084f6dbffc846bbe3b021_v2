與桿身的\n夾角不僅比非優秀選手的夾角小且造就在桿頭上有較快的速度產生。並且提出手腕\n太早釋放會減少桿頭速度，而如有其適當的手腕延遲釋放點，對於桿頭速度的增加\n\n-- 29 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫委員會\n\n影響更大。\n楊佳元、鄭誠諒與湯文慈 (2005) 以國內 12 名 (6 男 6 女) 優秀大專高爾夫選手\n為受測對象，其平均年齡 22.8±1.5 歲，平均差點＜5，分析手腕釋放點到擊球點的時\n間，觀察手掌相對於前臂座標軸的角速度數據資料，並定義在每一單位時間內的速\n度變化，明顯增大到 3m/s 時，稱之手腕釋放點。結果顯示時間範圍為 108ms～220ms，\n平均為 161±45 ms，且進一步探討手腕釋放點到擊球點的時間與擊球時桿頭速度的\n相關性，結果顯示兩者呈現顯著負相關 (P＜.05) 。顯示國內優秀大專選手手腕釋放\n點到擊球時間越短，則桿頭速度可能有越高的現象。\n從以上的文獻結果，了解到在上桿時，手腕所做的曲腕動作，是為了在下桿時，\n利用腕部來做釋放動作，但是過早釋放和太晚釋放，均會減少桿頭的速度。因此推\n測出適時的釋放，才是能夠對桿頭速度達到最大的貢獻。\n除了利用高速攝影機拍攝動作，以定性分析在立體空間中的腕部所移動的距離，並\n進一步計算出腕部的速度和加速度參數值，來間接探討腕部釋放的時間點。不過，\n在最近幾年，技術理論基礎的建立及漸漸使用普及化的電腦模擬方式，不僅可節省\n人力、物力且可快速運算實驗數值，以節省時間，因此對於手腕釋放的時間點，則\n能夠進行更直接性的探討。\nSprigings and Neal (2000) 在 2D 的空間中，以球桿、非慣用手手臂和軀幹三個\n肢段連接成一個系統，再以電腦模擬方法探討手腕在下桿時其力矩的時間變化，在\n比較有使用手腕力矩和無使用力矩後的差異後，提出擊球前的手腕釋放時間點早晚\n均會影響到桿頭的速度，此結果與先前學者提出的結果相呼應 (Neal.＆Wilson.,1985;\nMcLaughlin.＆Best.,1994) 並且更進一步提出最理想的手腕釋放時間點為擊球前的\n50ms，晩於 50ms 或是早於 50ms 在桿頭速度表現上分別減少最大速度的 4.6％和 2\n％。\nSprigings and Mackenzie (2002) 在 2D 的空間中，使用電腦模擬\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
