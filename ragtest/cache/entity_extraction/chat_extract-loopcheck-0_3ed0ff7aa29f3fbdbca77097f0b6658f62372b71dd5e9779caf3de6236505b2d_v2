�上肢局部肌體鞭打動作的協調用力訓練。特別是在針對增加擊球距離的高爾夫\n揮桿技術的專項力量訓練中，為了實現“\n加速”\n的運動力學法則，尤其要注重對環節\n一整體整合訓練原則的運用，以提高訓練的實效性。\n四、組合、循環漸進原則\n為了使專項力量訓練更貼近專項技術運動環節連續性特點，符合專項技術肌肉\n活動方式，應大量採取組合性的力量練習;同時，為了使專項力量技術化 (接近專項\n技術動作特點) ，在力量訓練中應貫徹循序漸進的訓練方法。這要求我們在進行揮桿\n\n-- 73 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫委員會\n\n技術專項力量訓練過程中重視對“\n組合-循環漸進原則”\n的貫徹。該原則要求我們在進\n行揮桿專項力量訓練時，要注意根據揮桿技術不同訓練階段的任務要求將揮桿專項\n力量訓練內容由易到難、突出重點，有針對性地合理搭配，進行組合-循環練習。這\n種由一般到逐漸通過增加難度向專項技術訓練過度的專項力量訓練方法，充分利用\n了運動素質轉移的原理機制，不僅有利於全面、協調、漸進地提高揮桿專項力量，\n同時，也使專項力量練習技術化，最大限度地提高揮桿技術訓練水準。\n\n伍、結語\n目前，運動訓練學界認為，專項力量訓練水準的高低是衡量運動員訓練水準高\n低最主要的競技能力指標之一。高球運動是一種典型的技能型運動，揮桿技術又是\n高球技術中一種重要的運動技術，要使其專項力量訓練科學化水準得到進一步提\n升，必須加強該專項力量訓練的理論與方法研究。而在加強揮桿技術專項力量訓練\n理論研究的過程中，我們必須借助現代運動訓練學先進的訓練理論與訓練方法，如\n從目前國內外的研究成果來看，運用運動生物力學的方法來研究技能類項目的專項\n力量訓練的理論與方法的發展趨勢正逐漸加強，這一嶄新的訓練思想和方法應引起\n我們足夠地重視。\n######################\nOutput:",
