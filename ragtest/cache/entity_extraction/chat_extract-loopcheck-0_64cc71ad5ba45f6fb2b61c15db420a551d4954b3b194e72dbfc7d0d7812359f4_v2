Hz）對\n於揮桿速度的影響，研究結果發現振動刺激對使用X硬度桿身的揮桿桿頭速度有負面\n的影響（圖七），但是對於R與L硬度桿身的揮桿桿頭速度沒有影響。\n\n圖七、振動刺激對不同硬度桿身的桿頭揮桿速度影響（Osis & Stefanyshyn, 2012）。\n\n整體來說，高爾夫使用者桿頭速度的快慢，會影響到使用者適合的桿身硬度。\n桿身軟硬度可能影響到擊球時的擊球桿面觸球點，進而造成球的後旋轉、側旋轉產\n生變化，最終造成擊球距離的差異性不大。增加球桿桿身長度可能造成其他桿身的\n變項產生變化，因此不一定會增加擊球的距離。而且，使用手臂的振動刺激器可能\n會影響使用X硬度桿身的擊球效益。\n\n伍、結語\n對於一般高爾夫的愛好者來說，透過高爾夫球桿身的實際測驗，進而獲得最合\n適的高爾夫球桿是很重要的。包括使用者的差點高低、揮桿桿頭速度快慢等，都是\n在選定桿身時的重要依據，而且實際把球桿拿到實驗室，進行不同桿身硬度（CPM）、\n長度、重量、扭力偏角、揮桿重量等條件的實際擊球效益測試，包括測試飛行軌跡\n擊球準確度、測試桿面觸球點、測試桿身彎曲角度、以及碰撞擊球時的桿頭速度等，\n進而選定最合適的球桿，提升高爾夫的運動競技表現。\n\n--
