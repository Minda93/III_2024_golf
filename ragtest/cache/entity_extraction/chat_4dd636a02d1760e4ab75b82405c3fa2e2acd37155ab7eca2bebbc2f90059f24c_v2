Poor posture can lead to injuries, swing path deviations, and lack of fluidity and rhythm, affecting subsequent actions and results in hitting the ball.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLUBFACE<|>TERMINOLOGY<|>The clubface's orientation at impact—square, open, or closed—directly influences the ball's flight direction. A square clubface sends the ball straight towards the target, an open clubface causes the ball to veer right, and a closed clubface sends it left. Correct clubface alignment is crucial for desired ball flight.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWING PATH<|>TERMINOLOGY<|>The swing path, also known as the swing plane, is a primary factor determining the ball's flight line. An inside-out swing path tends to push the ball right, while an outside-in path pulls the ball left.
