右圖：丁麗芬、林寶城，2004）。\n\n過去也有一些研究（Worobets & Stefanyshyn, 2007；Kenny, Wallace, & Otto,\n2008；Betzler, 2010；Osis & Stefanyshyn, 2012；Worobets & Stefanyshyn, 2012），採\n用桿頭速度、球速的高低、球的旋轉角速度等變項，做為球桿桿身功能效益的依變\n項。\n\n肆、桿身軟硬度差異的影響\n一般的高爾夫愛好者在選定高爾夫球桿時，第一個要專業考量的因素經常是高\n爾夫球桿桿身的軟硬度。大部分的球具製作商與高爾夫教練，都會推薦女性球友選\n擇硬度較軟的L桿身、年紀較大的球友選擇硬度低於一般標準桿身的A桿身、初學者\n的男性則會推薦R桿身的標準硬度球桿。到底球桿桿身硬度差異，會不會影響擊球的\n效益呢？\nBetzler（2012）在桿頭速度為45 m/s與50 m/s時，使用L、R、X硬度桿身的擊球\n速度快慢，研究發現在桿頭速度較低（45 m/s）的條件下，較軟的桿身（L）可以獲\n得較高的擊球球速、以及較少的旋轉速度；當桿頭的速度較快（50 m/s）時，擊球的\n球速則不受桿身軟硬度的影響，但是會顯著增加球的旋轉速度（圖五）\n。Betzler, Monk,\nWallace與Otto (2012) 針對20名男性高爾夫選手，測試L硬度與X硬度桿身的結果也類\nBetzler (2012) 的研究結果。有此可見，使用者桿頭速度的快慢，確實會影響到適合\n的桿身硬度。\n\n-- 64 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊 第九期\n\n圖五、不同桿身軟硬度在45 m/s (a)與50 m/s (b)桿頭速度下\n擊球球速與球旋轉的比較（Betzler, 2010）。\n\nStanbridge, Jones與Mitchell (2004) 則以桿面觸球點測量，判斷長春組高爾夫選手\n使用三種不同桿身軟硬度（club1：324 CPM、club2：267 CPM、club3：232 CPM）\n的合適性；研究發現不同桿身軟硬度的擊球距離與桿面觸球點準確度並沒有顯著的\n差異，但是桿面觸球點的準確度似乎有桿身較軟（232 CPM）的準確性較高的趨向（圖\n六）。Wallace與Hubbell (2001) 的研究也發現，不同能力的高爾夫愛好者，使用不同\n硬度（flexible：283 CPM、regular：310 CPM、stiff：CPM 336）的桿身對於桿頭速\n度並沒有顯著的影響（圖七）\n。由以往研究發現，桿身軟硬度確實影響到擊球時的擊\n球點，進而造成球的後旋轉與側旋轉產生變化，最\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
