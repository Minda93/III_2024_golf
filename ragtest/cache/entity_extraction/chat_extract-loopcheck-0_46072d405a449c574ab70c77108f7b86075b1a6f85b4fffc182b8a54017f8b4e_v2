或是早於 50ms 在桿頭速度表現上分別減少最大速度的 4.6％和 2\n％。\nSprigings and Mackenzie (2002) 在 2D 的空間中，使用電腦模擬方法，比較三種\n模型的手腕釋放動作與桿頭速度大小的關聯，三種模型分別是正常釋放手腕模型\n(SIM1) 、延遲釋放手腕且使用腕部力矩模型 (SIM2) 和延遲釋放手腕但不使用腕部\n力矩模型 (SIM3) 。其結果如圖一所示，三個模型在擊球點時的最大桿頭速度分別\n為 38.9 m/s (SIM1) 、44.7 m/s (SIM2) 和 44.0 m/s (SIM3) ，顯示出延遲手腕釋放動\n作模型 (SIM2)的最大桿頭速度比正常手腕釋放動作模型 (SIM1) 的最大桿頭速度\n快 5.8m/s，而且也比雖有延遲手腕釋放動作，但卻無使用手腕力矩的模型 (SIM3) 的\n最大桿頭速度快 0.7 m/s。除此之外，從圖一中的腕部速度曲線中，也可以再次確切\n了解到腕部動作不應太早或是太晚釋放，其結果都會影響到桿頭速度。因此，手腕\n動作利用電腦模擬的方式來做探討的優點，是除了運算數據快速能減少時間外，且\n可以控制模型在每一次測試中均有固定的揮桿方式，以減少外在因素影響而能夠增\n加數據的準確性，最終才有更精準的動作分析過程。\n\n-- 30 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊 第五期\n\n圖一 三種模型在最大桿頭速度下的比較。\n(摘自 Sprigings＆Mackenzie, 2002)\nTang (2002) 使用電腦模擬方式，以 8 名 (4 男、4 女) 美國優秀大專選手為受試\n對象 (平均差點＜5) ，探討下桿擊球過程中，觀察非慣用手腕部加速度隨時間變化\n的參數值，找出其手腕釋放的時間點，結果顯示出手腕釋放時間點範圍為擊球前的\n100ms～150 間，且提出非慣用手手腕延遲釋放動作有助於增加桿頭速度的現象。\n從以上的文獻可以了解，非慣用手手腕的曲腕動作是為了釋放而做準備，起進\n一步認為手腕的釋放動作應該需要延遲，而且還要在適當的時機時釋放，才是對桿\n頭有最大的貢獻。\n\n肆、結論\n延遲釋放手腕的技巧對於桿頭速度，確實佔著相當重要的因素，不過國內優秀\n大專選手的手腕釋放點到擊球點時間，不僅多於國外職業選手的 100ms～80ms\n(Neal 等，1985) ，也多於國外優秀大專選手的 100ms～150ms (Tang,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPRIGINGS AND
