：從瞄球點到上揮頂點；第二階段為開始期\n(initiation)：從上揮頂點至腕關節的角度達最小角度時，第三階段為擊球期 (hitting)：\n從腕關節達最小角度至擊球點。Pink, Perry 與 Jobe (1993) 將高爾夫揮桿動作分成五\n個時期，包括上揮期 (take away)、下揮前期 (forward swing)、加速期 (acceleration)、\n跟隨前期 (early follow-through) 與跟隨後期 (late follow-through)，各時期的動作為：\n(1).上揮期 (take away)：從球的位置後轉 (backswing) 至動作最後定點，上揮頂點。\n(2).下揮前期 (forward swing) ：從上揮頂點揮桿至球桿呈水平的位置。\n(3).加速期 (acceleration)：從球桿成水平的位置至擊球的位置。\n(4).跟隨前期 (early follow-through)：從擊球瞬間至球桿呈水平的位置。\n(5).跟隨後期 (late follow-through) ：從球桿呈水平位置至整個動作的結束。\n儘管揮桿動作的分期眾說紛紜，不過依據 Pink, Perry 與 Jobe (1993) 的五個揮桿\n分期，更適合用來進行揮桿動作的解說。其實，在揮桿過程的三個幾乎停止的動作：\n描球姿勢、上揮頂點、結束動作，也是進行揮桿動作說明的重要依據 (圖五)。\n\n圖五、揮桿動作的描球姿勢(左)、上揮頂點(中)、(右)動作結束\n在開始上揮動作之前，描球資料要將背部打直，注意握桿、球位、站姿 (腳寬\n度、背部、雙手、描球方向、球位距離等，圖五左、圖六左上) 等的確定。很多揮\n桿前的動作靜態變項，都是決定揮桿結果的重要因素。\n在上揮期時，應全心注視著球，以左手臂帶動球桿上揮時，應注意球桿上揮的\n方向不宜直接向後 (圖六右上) ，上揮的頂點應達到左肩完全旋轉到球位的方向 (圖\n六左下)、身體的重心應該保持在雙腳中心 (圖六右下)，一直到上揮的頂點 (圖五中)\n為止。此時右腳的動作應該與描球姿勢相同、左腳膝蓋向內、腰部約轉動 45 度、左\n肩應與下巴接觸、右手上臂持緒夾緊身體。\n在下揮前期時，則以釋放軀幹的扭轉為起點，此時為了可以帶動身體的旋轉擊\n球，以右腳肘關節與左腰為中心的旋轉起動，也是必要的下揮前期動作。由於還未\n\n-- 55 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊編輯委員會\n\n到揮桿擊球加速期，因此應有球桿維持等速下揮的感覺，此時左手腕的屈腕動作要\n一直保留到手部到達與地面水平之加速期之前。下揮前期\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PINK, PERRY
