，而身體下肢、軀幹、上肢部位大小肌群協調\n用力配合是揮桿技術的要點。\n\n参、高爾夫揮桿旋轉中心與力量運用\n一、高爾夫揮桿的旋轉中心點\n最早提出揮桿旋轉中心點為Runyan (1970) 認為高爾夫揮桿的旋轉中心為頸背\n部的突起處，並命名為懸掛點 (suspension point) ，而肩與雙臂圍繞此點做揮桿動作。\n直至王建智 (1990) ，在台灣Golfer Digest中以連續專欄的內容，明確命名「頸椎第\n七節」為“\n軸頂點”\n，並加以說明該點在動作上的意義與目的，\nBob與Robert (1998) 認為脊柱是揮桿旋轉系統的旋轉軸，脊柱的傾斜角度會直\n接影響揮桿的平面，脊柱傾斜角度越少，則揮桿平面越平，打擊點也離雙腳越遠，\n脊柱傾斜角越大則相反。澳洲高爾夫名將Norman (1988) 指出在揮桿當中雙眼需注視\n著球，且頭不因上桿與下桿而有所移動，而頭的位置即為頸椎的延伸，頸椎固定頭\n才可不動，Toski等 (1998) 認為脊柱為揮桿旋轉系統的旋轉軸，且更進一步指出，\n頸椎上有一凸起點稱為懸掛點，而揮桿平面與此點相交，此懸掛點至球的假想直線\n即是揮桿的半徑 (圖一) ，所以此點的移動將直接影響揮桿平面及擊到球的位置，如\n此也證明了擊球前頭不動的原理。\n\n-- 70

。此外\nBarretine、Fleisin與Johnson (1994) 比較職業選手、業餘選手與一般人，發現下桿時\n職業選手左足外翻的扭力特別顯著，相對於桿頭的速度特別快速，同時職業選手由\n右腳最大垂直分力至左腳最大垂直分力的時間很短，而且左足最大垂直分力 (vertical\npeak value ) 的時間產生在桿頭觸球的時間之前。\n根據Frank等 (1986) ，所做高爾夫旋轉肌群運動傷害的實驗，將動作分為上桿\n期 (takeaway 或 back swing ) 、 下 桿 期 (forward 或 down swing) 、 加 速 期\n(acceleration) 、跟隨早\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
