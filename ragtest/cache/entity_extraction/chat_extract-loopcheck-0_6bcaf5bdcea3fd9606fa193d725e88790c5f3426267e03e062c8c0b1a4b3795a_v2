六位初學者和六位優秀球員\n所做的研究指出，優秀選手的轉動中心至球桿頭的半徑長的最大值出現在接近擊球\n點時，而初學者的最大半徑則出現在擊球後。Watanabe, Kuroki, Hokari 與 Nishizawa\n(1999)

的最大值出\n現在接近擊球點時，而初學者則出現在擊球後。\n高爾夫球揮桿動作是一三度空間的動作模式，為一多關節聯合的動作，身體的\n控制模式相當的複雜，若要完全了解其動作在運動學上和動力學上的變化，則需以\n精密的儀器來研究。目前在高爾夫揮桿的研究大部分以測力板、攝影資料分析法及\n肌電圖等方法來研究，或是以單一方法，或是聯合幾種方法，但由於所使用的受試\n者同質性的差異、研究方法上的不盡相同等，使有關高爾夫揮桿動作特徵的描述，\n仍有顯著的差異存在。\n\n參、高爾夫揮桿動作的分期\n高爾夫揮桿動作的分期常隨著研究者或其研究目的的不同，而有不一樣的分\n期。Maddalozzo
