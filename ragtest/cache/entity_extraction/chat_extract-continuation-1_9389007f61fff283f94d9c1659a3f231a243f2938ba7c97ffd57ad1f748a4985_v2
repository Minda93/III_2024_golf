業餘的高爾夫愛好者在合適的球具、適當的練習下，即能夠在很\n短的時間，就具備不錯的揮桿距離與擊球準確性，進而體驗到高爾夫球運動的樂趣。\n2012年職業高爾夫協會 (PGA) 比賽的平均開球距離第一名為315.5碼 (Bubba\nWatson) ，前100名的平均開球距離皆在290碼以上；10年前 (2002年) 的平均開球距\n離第一名為306.8碼 (John Daly) ，前100名的平均開球距離在280碼以上；20年前\n(1992年) 的平均開球距離第一名為283.4碼 (John Daly) ，前100名的平均開球距離在\n260碼以上；30年前 (1982年) 的平均開球距離第一名為275.3碼 (Bill Calfee) ，前100\n名的平均開球距離在254碼以上（http://www.pgatour.com/r/stats/ info/xm.html?101）。\n由此可見，職業高爾夫選手近30年來，開球平均距離增加了40碼，前20年幾乎每10\n年會增加約10碼，而且，最近10年則明顯增加了20碼；今年（2012年）平均開球距\n\n-- 59 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊編輯委員會\n\n離第100名的高爾夫選手，在20年前則排名第一。隨著高爾夫球桿桿身科技的進步，\n已經讓高爾夫球的擊球距離極大化。選定合適的高爾夫球桿與桿身，就成為一個提\n升高爾夫比賽表現的重要條件之一。\n高爾夫球桿是由球頭、桿身及握把三部分組合而成，桿身的設計是影響高爾夫\n球桿功能最重要的部分（王宏宗、吳兆欣，2000；丁麗芬、林寶城，2004）。選定\n穩定性高的桿身，經常是選手改進擊球路徑的重要策略，在這種條件下，各家球具\n廠商無不花費大量金錢與時間，研發出更優質的桿身，進而讓優秀的高爾夫選手與\n一般球友都可以透過球具提升表現。馬義傑（2007）的研究指出，製造商在進行球\n桿屬性區隔時，大多是以桿身的變化為主軸，同時會在球桿桿身上標示出桿身規格，\n以便讓球友選定球桿桿身時有更明確的依據。\n本研究以文獻探討的方式，進行高爾夫球桿擊球距離與穩定的桿身因素分析，\n並且進一步瞭解評量桿身功能的重要變項與實際影響。期望透過文獻整理後的結\n果，提供高爾夫球友選定合適桿身的參考依據，進而達到提升高爾夫運動表現的效\n果。\n\n貳、影響高爾夫擊球效益的桿身因素\n影響高爾夫球桿擊球距離與穩定的桿身因素，包括曲折點
