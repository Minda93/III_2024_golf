�轉動的協調性，更會影響穩定的桿頭圓周軌跡與擊球的效\n率。（劉玉仁等，2004）\n1990 年Pink, Jobe與Perry 等學者提出，高爾夫運動並不需要較強烈的手臂活\n動，因此上肢不需很大的肌力及關節活動度。雖然如此，但因高爾夫揮桿動作是一\n快速之動作，因此需要肩部旋轉肌肉群 (rotator cuff muscles) 之同時作用來提供動作\n之協調性並預防盂肱關節 (glenohumeral complex) 之受傷。而旋轉肌肉群在揮桿過程\n中，每一肌肉之活化時間不盡相同，是為了使揮桿動作更順暢，故有效的從事每一\n肌肉之肌力強化訓練，將可使揮桿動作更流暢。\n理想的揮桿動作應是全身肢段、關節、肌肉與球桿的一體動作，時間上一致的\n運動技術。揮擊過程中，特別是較長的球桿應用時，不當的局部加速或加力，都易\n使球捍失控、失準而產生反效果。雖然在球場環境的不同變化、球位的地形地物以\n及天候等外在因素，加上個人的體能及心理壓力、專注力等內在因素，使得高爾夫\n在應用技巧上產生了極高的複雜性，然而，理解基本動作因果關係與技術原理，再\n加以有效訓練，亦不難收其成效（劉玉仁，2004）。\n\n-- 43 --\n\n\f大專高爾夫學刊編輯委員會\n\n參、揮桿動作與右曲球的關係\n一、握桿\n桿面的回正，涉及到手腕的回直時機，但假如你的握桿不正確或太弱勢，即便\n是你有絕佳的手眼協調能力，也難以在快速的揮桿動作中去彌補它。\n所謂的握桿太弱勢，指的是左手握球桿，是以左拇指按在握把的正上方，致使\n拇指與食指所形成的虎口對向握把左側。這樣的握桿本身就難以回正桿面，縱使右\n手多用力去趕上，桿面也總是開放的，球尾一定都會右曲；相反的，如果握桿太強\n勢，也就是左手的虎口對向握把的右側，桿面在觸球時就容易左蓋，反而形成左曲\n球。這兩種握法是過與不及，都無法讓你避開曲球的煩惱。\n正確的握桿應該是自然握法，左手的虎口是對著握把的正上方，通常握把上會\n有一個長條形的標誌可以校正。右手再輕鬆地包覆上去，基本上虎口也是對向上方，\n與左手的虎口線平行。這樣子主控桿面狀態的左手，與主宰力道的右手就不會角色\n不清，造成互相干擾與阻礙。\n建議在調整好握桿後，先輕鬆地擊球，注意球出去的方向是否與所要的一致；\n如果\n######################\nOutput:",
