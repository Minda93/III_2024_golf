吳鳳科技大學\n\n摘要\n高爾夫球桿是由球頭、桿身及握把三部分組合而成，桿身的設計是影響高爾夫\n球桿功能最重要的部分。影響高爾夫球桿擊球距離與穩定的桿身因素，包括曲折點\n(bent point or keick point) 、軟硬度、扭力、重量、長度、揮桿重量、以及桿身脊線\n(spine) 等。實際進行桿身功能實驗的依變項，包括飛行軌跡擊球準確度測量、桿面\n觸球點測量、桿身彎曲角度測量等，而且桿頭速度、球速、以及球旋轉速度等，都\n是評量桿身擊球效益的有效變項。使用者桿頭速度的快慢，會影響到使用者適合的\n桿身硬度。桿身軟硬度可能影響到擊球時的擊球桿面觸球點，進而造成球的後旋轉、\n側旋轉產生變化，最終造成擊球距離的差異性不大。增加球桿桿身長度不一定會增\n加擊球距離。而且，使用手臂的振動刺激器可能會影響使用X硬度桿身的擊球效益。\n高爾夫球使用者有必要實際測試合適各項的桿身因素，選定適合自己動作的桿身，\n進而提升高爾夫擊球效益與比賽表現。\n關鍵詞：高爾夫球桿、桿身、桿身硬度、桿身長度\n通訊作者：王順正 (grcscw@ccu.edu.tw)\n\n壹、前言\n高爾夫球運動在高爾夫球桿科技的進展下，平均開球距離超過300碼的高爾夫選\n手比比皆是；很多業餘的高爾夫愛好者在合適的球具、適當的練習下，即能夠在很\n短的時間，就具備不錯的揮桿距離與擊球準確性，進而體驗到高爾夫球運動的�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
